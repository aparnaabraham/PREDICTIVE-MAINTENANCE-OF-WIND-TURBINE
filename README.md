# PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE-OF-WIND-TURBINE
Modern data driven solution for efficient wind energy production with IoT 

Problem Statement:
There is no system to detect anomalies and anticipate failure of wind turbines.

Solution:
Wind farm owners, employees and end users who use windmills as a source of energy for various activities can benefit from this product.
Various parameters and their variations being gathered and stored in the Cloud brings out the uniqueness of the product/solution.
Similar solutions have been implemented in wind farms in other countries.

Approach:
Problem is tackled using IoT and ML
A set of sensors take values of turbine vibration and temperature and transmit it to base station using LoRa
Base station received the LoRa packets and the sensor data is processed by ML algorithms implemented in Raspberry Pi
Emergency turn OFF controls are there along with the sensor acquisition system
ML algorithms are developed using predictive maintenance packages from MATLAB
